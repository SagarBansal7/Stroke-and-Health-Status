# Stroke and Health Status
## Graduate Course: Intermediate Statistical Modeling for Business ##

This was a group project from a course on Intermediate Statistical Modeling for Business. Here's a brief summary of the project:

>With the improvements of living standards, people nowadays pay more attention to their health. This report talks about stroke, one of the biggest health problems in the U.S., focusing on the pre-existing health factors that will potentially rise oneâ€™s risk of getting a stroke. We investigated relationships between stroke and other factors including age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, body mass index, and smoking status. With the logistic regression model we fitted, it is clear that within the six factors, body mass index is the only factor that has little association with whether a person will get a stroke or not. The cluster analysis model showed
that age and average glucose level are important factors that helped conclude the four different groups of people.
